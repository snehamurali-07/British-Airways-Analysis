# British-Airways-Analysis
Description:

This project analyzes customer reviews of British Airways by scraping extensive review data from the Skytrax website and cleaning it for analysis. The initial task involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) using techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to uncover insights from the reviews. Following this, the dataset is explored to understand its structure and prepared for predictive modeling by creating new features. A machine learning model, such as Random Forest, is then trained to predict customer booking behavior, allowing for an analysis of how various features contribute to the model's predictive power. The overall goal is to provide actionable insights that can enhance customer experience and improve operational strategies for British Airways.

Key Features:

Data scraping from Skytrax for customer reviews.
